# Ranki MCP — Free SEO, AEO, speed and image-optimization MCP for Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf and ChatGPT

> The MCP that doesn't just report — your agent fixes. Audits any URL for SEO and Answer Engine Optimization, measures real Core Web Vitals via Google PageSpeed Insights, and instructs your agent to convert images to AVIF and WebP, rewrite `<img>` tags into responsive `<picture>` with `srcset` and `alt`, drop in JSON-LD schema, generate `sitemap.xml` / `llms.txt` / `robots.txt`, classify hidden pages — then re-runs the audit to prove the score moved. All inside Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf and ChatGPT Desktop.

## Install in one line

```bash
npx @ranki.io/cli install
```

The CLI auto-detects which AI editor you have installed (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, ChatGPT Desktop), writes the right MCP config in the right place and downloads the companion Skill file from the [ranki-seo-skills repo](https://github.com/1fancy/ranki-seo-skills). Re-run `npx @ranki.io/cli update` later to refresh the Skill; `npx @ranki.io/cli check` verifies the setup.

Prefer the manual JSON snippet? Examples for each editor are in the [Install](#install) section below.

## Two implementations, same tools

This repo ships the MCP in **two parity implementations** so you can pick whichever fits your stack:

- **[`server/`](server) — PHP 8.4 reference**, the production deployment powering [`mcp.ranki.io`](https://mcp.ranki.io). Hosted, hardened, zero dependencies, runs behind Cloudflare. This is what `mcp.ranki.io` is built on.
- **[`ts-server/`](ts-server) — Node / TypeScript reference**, published as [`@ranki.io/seo-aeo-mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ranki.io/seo-aeo-mcp) on npm. Native-Node alternative for developers who prefer JavaScript tooling, installable via `npx -y @ranki.io/seo-aeo-mcp` (stdio) or `npx @ranki.io/seo-aeo-mcp --serve` (HTTP).

Both expose the same 22 tools with the same JSON output, SSRF guard, rate-limit semantics, and security posture. The TS impl runs the 15 free tools natively in Node, and proxies the 7 paid bridge tools to the same REST API at `app.ranki.io` that the PHP server uses. Neither ever opens a database — paid tools go through Laravel's `ApiKeyAuth` middleware and are scoped to the calling user's data.

## What it actually does — 22 tools

The MCP server exposes 22 tools. Your agent calls them like any other MCP tool; they return Markdown reports your agent renders inline and then acts on — converting files, rewriting HTML, generating new ones, committing the result.

### Audit
- **`audit_seo(url)`** — 10-check on-page SEO scorecard: title length, meta description, H1 uniqueness, canonical, viewport, HTTPS, OpenGraph completeness, image alt coverage, internal link count, JSON-LD presence. Returns score 0–100 with per-failure fix recipes.
- **`audit_aeo(url)`** — 8-check Answer Engine Optimization scorecard: FAQPage / Article JSON-LD, definitional intro under 80 words, author byline, `llms.txt` presence, `robots.txt` allows GPTBot / ClaudeBot / PerplexityBot, answer-style H2/H3 headings, comparison tables.
- **`audit_hidden_pages(urls, domain)`** — classifies each path as `robots-disallow`, `noindex`, `keep` or `unsure` with reasoning. Catches admin routes, API endpoints, drafts, login pages, account dashboards, thank-you pages, build artifacts and search-result URLs. Returns a ready-to-paste `robots.txt` block.

### Speed and images — this is the part nothing else does
- **`audit_speed(url, strategy)`** — real Lighthouse scores (Performance, Accessibility, SEO, Best Practices) and Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, INP, FCP, TTFB) via Google PageSpeed Insights. Returns image opportunities with bytes saved per file, render-blocking JS / CSS, and failing on-page SEO audits. Default strategy is `mobile` (Google ranks mobile-first).
- **`audit_core_web_vitals(url)`** — one paragraph per metric with the literal fix recipe. *"LCP element is hero.png at 2.4 MB, convert to WebP saves 1.8 MB → -1.1s LCP."* Picks the LCP element URL out of Lighthouse so the agent knows exactly which file to optimize.
- **`optimize_images(images, max_width)`** — for each image: target format (AVIF + WebP), responsive 1×/2× widths, alt-text suggestion, the literal `sharp-cli` / `cwebp` / `avifenc` commands, and a ready-to-paste `<picture>` block with `srcset`. Your agent runs the conversion locally in the repo and rewrites the `<img>` tags.

### Generate
- **`generate_sitemap_xml(urls)`** — builds a deploy-ready `sitemap.xml` from a URL list with current `lastmod` timestamps.
- **`generate_llms_txt(site_name, summary, key_pages)`** — generates `llms.txt`, the emerging standard for telling AI crawlers what your site is and which pages to cite.
- **`generate_robots_txt(sitemap_url, allow_ai, disallow_paths)`** — builds a `robots.txt` that explicitly allows or denies GPTBot, ChatGPT-User, ClaudeBot, anthropic-ai, PerplexityBot and Google-Extended.

### Content and strategy
- **`seo_starter_kit(domain)`** — returns the four baseline files most vibe-coded sites are missing (`robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `llms.txt`, JSON-LD) ready to paste into your repo.
- **`find_topic_ideas(url)`** — reads your homepage, infers your niche, and returns a structured brief for generating 15 article topics across informational, commercial and transactional intent with prioritization criteria.
- **`find_keyword_gap(url, competitors)`** — returns a step-by-step methodology for finding keywords competitors rank for but you don't. If no competitors are given, instructs your editor to ask first.
- **`propose_titles_metas(urls, focus_keyword)`** — extracts the actual title, h1 and first paragraph from each URL (or accepts a free-text description for un-deployed pages), then returns a Markdown table with 5 title and meta description candidates per page across 5 angles (descriptive, benefit-led, question-format, specific-number, keyword-first). Each candidate is flagged for length compliance.
- **`explain_seo_terms(category)`** — reference glossary of 40+ SEO and AEO terms: SEO, AEO, GEO, JSON-LD, FAQPage, canonical, `llms.txt`, Core Web Vitals, E-E-A-T, helpful content update, doorway pages, and more. Filter by category: basics, AEO, technical, analytics, penalty.

### Install
- **`install_skill(agent)`** — returns the install commands for the [ranki-seo-skills](https://github.com/1fancy/ranki-seo-skills) Skill across Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude.ai web Projects and generic `AGENTS.md` agents.

### Your Ranki.io account — real ranking data inside your IDE (paid API key)
- **`get_account()`** — whoami for your API key: name, email, plan, daily and monthly limits, current usage.
- **`list_projects()`** — lists projects in your [Ranki.io](https://ranki.io) account.
- **`list_articles(project_id)`** — paginated index of articles in a project: nano_id, title, status, language, focus_keyword[], TOC outline, word count, SEO score. Optional status filter.
- **`get_article(article_id)`** — fetches a single article by its `nano_id`: title, HTML, focus keywords, table of contents, embedded image URLs, SEO score.
- **`list_rank_tracking(project_id)`** — Google Search Console summary for a project: 28-day totals, top 20 keywords by clicks, top 20 opportunity keywords (position > 10 with impressions — the easy wins).
- **`list_gsc_keywords(project_id)`** — full paginated GSC keyword list, sortable by clicks / impressions / position / CTR.
- **`ai_visibility(project_id)`** — recorded AI-citation snapshots: which of your tracked topics appeared in ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity and Google AI Overview SERPs at capture time.

## How a typical session looks

```text
You:    audit my site speed and fix the slow images

Claude: → Calling ranki.audit_speed(url="https://myapp.dev")
        ← Lighthouse: 42 perf · LCP 4.8s · 3 images blocking the paint.
        → Calling ranki.optimize_images([hero.png, banner.jpg, card.png])…
        ← 3 files, recipes returned.
        → Running sharp-cli to convert hero.png → hero.avif + hero.webp + hero@2x.avif…
        → Editing app/page.tsx — rewriting <img> as <picture srcset>, adding alt text…
        → Calling ranki.audit_speed again to verify…
        ← Lighthouse: 96 perf · LCP 1.4s.

You:    now find pages that shouldn't be in Google

Claude: → Calling ranki.audit_hidden_pages(domain="https://myapp.dev")
        ← 8 robots-disallow, 12 noindex, 118 keep, 4 unsure.
        → Editing public/robots.txt to disallow /admin /dashboard /checkout /account…
        → Adding <meta name="robots" content="noindex"> to app/search/page.tsx…
        Done. Submit URL-removal requests in Search Console for the 8 admin pages.
```

The Skill file (in [ranki-seo-skills](https://github.com/1fancy/ranki-seo-skills)) tells your agent when to call which tool, in what order, and where in your repo to apply each fix.

## Rate limits

| Tier | Daily cap | Scope | Tools available |
|---|---|---|---|
| No key | 5 calls | per IP | 15 free tools (audits, generators, speed, image optimization, content strategy, install) |
| Ranki.io API key | 500 calls | per key | All 22 tools, including the 7 bridge tools that read your real GSC keywords, rank tracking, AI citations, project list and article library from your Ranki.io account |

Get a key at [app.ranki.io/developer](https://app.ranki.io/developer). `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining` and `X-RateLimit-Reset` are returned on every response. The dispatcher's error messages include the reset countdown and the upgrade path.

---

## Install

### Claude Desktop / Claude Code (recommended for most vibe-coders)

Add to `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ranki": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@ranki.io/mcp"],
      "env": { "RANKI_API_KEY": "rk_live_..." }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. The MCP indicator should show **ranki** with 22 tools.

### Cursor (HTTP transport, no npx needed)

`.cursor/mcp.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ranki": {
      "url": "https://mcp.ranki.io",
      "headers": { "X-API-Key": "rk_live_..." }
    }
  }
}
```

### ChatGPT Desktop, Continue.dev, Zed, anything MCP-capable

If the client supports stdio MCP, use the Claude Desktop snippet. If it supports HTTP MCP, use the Cursor snippet.

### Get your free API key

Visit [app.ranki.io/developer](https://app.ranki.io/developer) and click **Reveal**. Your key already exists — every Ranki.io account gets one auto-created. Free advisor tools work without a key (5 calls/IP/day); the `list_projects` and `get_article` bridge tools require one.

## How vibe-coders use it

### Scenario 1: "I just shipped a site, what do I do?"

```
You: I just shipped my Next.js app at https://myapp.com. What SEO do I need?

Claude (via Ranki MCP):
  → Calling seo_starter_kit(domain="myapp.com")
  ← [Returns robots.txt + sitemap.xml + llms.txt + JSON-LD templates]
  → Writing public/robots.txt
  → Writing public/sitemap.xml (enumerating pages from app/ directory…)
  → Writing public/llms.txt
  → Adding JSON-LD <script> to app/layout.tsx
  → Calling audit_seo to verify…
  ← Score: 92/100. 🎉
```

### Scenario 2: "Why isn't ChatGPT citing my docs?"

```
You: Why doesn't ChatGPT cite my docs site?

Claude (via Ranki MCP):
  → Calling audit_aeo(url="https://docs.myproduct.com")
  ← Score 38/100. Failing: no FAQPage schema, no llms.txt, robots.txt blocks ClaudeBot.
  → Fixing each failure in your repo…
  ← Score 88/100. Re-deploy and ChatGPT should pick it up within 7-14 days.
```

### Scenario 3: "I don't know what blog posts to write"

```
You: I have a Stripe alternative landing page but the blog is empty. Help.

Claude (via Ranki MCP):
  → Calling find_topic_ideas(url="https://mystripe-alt.com")
  ← [Returns brief with topic generation methodology + 15-topic structure]
  → [Generates 15 topics organized by intent, picks top 3]
  ← Recommended first 3 articles:
     1. "How to switch payment processors without losing customers" (transactional)
     2. "Stripe vs us: side-by-side fee comparison for $10K/mo MRR" (commercial)
     3. "What is interchange-plus pricing and why most SaaSes overpay" (informational)
```

### Scenario 4: "What gap keywords am I missing?"

```
You: My competitors are stripe.com and lemonsqueezy.com. What am I missing?

Claude (via Ranki MCP):
  → Calling find_keyword_gap(url="https://mystripe-alt.com",
                              competitors=["stripe.com","lemonsqueezy.com"])
  ← [Returns methodology + per-competitor analysis steps]
  → Crawling /blog on both competitors…
  → Cross-referencing against your sitemap…
  ← 5 high-value gaps found:
     - "PCI compliance for small SaaS" (covered by Stripe, not you)
     - "How to handle subscription dunning" (covered by both, not you)
     - … 3 more
```

### Two transports

- **stdio** (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, most MCP clients) — install the [`@ranki.io/mcp`](npx/) npm package, which is a 50-line Node.js shim that proxies stdio JSON-RPC to `https://mcp.ranki.io`.
- **HTTP** (Cursor, custom clients) — point at `https://mcp.ranki.io` directly. No Node install needed.

## SEO vs AEO — what's the difference?

**SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** is making your site rank in the classic 10 blue links on Google. The signals: title tags, meta descriptions, H1, canonicals, sitemap, internal links, page speed, mobile-friendly, HTTPS. Tools like Ahrefs / SEMrush / SurferSEO score these.

**AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)** is making your site **get cited** when ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, or Google AI Overviews answer a user's question. The signals are different:
- **FAQPage JSON-LD** — single biggest citation signal.
- **Definitional intros** — first paragraph is a concise "X is …" answer.
- **Author byline + E-E-A-T** — LLMs prefer cited sources with named authors.
- **`llms.txt`** — explicit invitation for LLMs to use your content.
- **`robots.txt` allowing AI bots** — GPTBot / ClaudeBot / PerplexityBot must NOT be blocked.
- **Answer-style headings** — H2/H3 phrased as questions ("What is X?", "How does X work?").
- **Comparison tables** — the highest-citation HTML element in AI Overviews.

`audit_aeo` checks all 8 of these and tells your AI exactly what to fix. As of 2026, **AEO traffic is the fastest-growing SEO channel** and most sites have zero coverage.

---

## llms.txt — the emerging AI-search standard

Inspired by `robots.txt` but for LLMs. A Markdown file at `/llms.txt` tells AI crawlers:
- What your site is about (in plain English, not metadata).
- Which pages are most important.
- How to cite you.

```markdown
# Acme Corp

> Acme makes the SDK for shipping React Native apps faster.

## Key pages

- [Homepage](https://acme.dev/)
- [Documentation](https://acme.dev/docs)
- [Pricing](https://acme.dev/pricing)
- [Blog](https://acme.dev/blog)

## About

- Founded 2024, based in Berlin.
- Used by 12,000+ teams including Linear and Notion.
- Open source SDK on github.com/acme/sdk.
```

Use `generate_llms_txt` to create one in 5 seconds.

---

## Self-hosting

The MCP server is plain PHP 8.4 — no framework, no database, no Composer dependencies. Drop the `server/` directory behind an Nginx vhost serving `public/index.php` and you're done.

```nginx
server {
  server_name mcp.yourdomain.com;
  root /var/www/ranki-mcp/server/public;
  index index.php;
  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
  }
  location ~ \.php$ {
    include fastcgi_params;
    fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.4-fpm.sock;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name;
  }
}
```

The `lib/ratelimit.php` uses files in `/tmp/` for IP rate-limiting — works out of the box. For Redis-backed rate limiting at scale, swap the implementation.

---

## Contributing

PRs welcome for new advisor tools. To add a tool:

1. Create `server/tools/your_tool.php` returning a callable `function (array $args, string $apiKey): array`.
2. Return `rk_mcp_text_content("...your structured advice...")`.
3. Register the tool in `server/lib/registry.php` under `rk_mcp_tool_definitions()`.

Tool naming: `<verb>_<noun>` snake_case (e.g. `audit_aeo`, `find_topic_ideas`).

Tool philosophy: **return data + instructions for the calling AI**, never call an LLM yourself.

---

## FAQ

### Does this cost money?
The advisor tools (everything except `list_projects` / `get_article`) are **free** — 5 calls per IP per UTC day. To remove that limit, get a free API key at [app.ranki.io/developer](https://app.ranki.io/developer). The bridge tools require a key because they pull your private Ranki.io data.

### Does Ranki MCP use my Claude credits?
**Yes — and only yours.** We never make LLM calls. The MCP server returns structured advice; your Claude / Cursor evaluates and acts on it using your own credits.

### Where does data flow?
- The advisor tools (`audit_*`, `generate_*`, `seo_starter_kit`, `find_*`) fetch the URL you pass (no other network calls).
- The bridge tools (`list_projects`, `get_article`) call `app.ranki.io/api/v1/...` over HTTPS with your `X-API-Key`.
- We don't log request bodies. We log IP + tool name + response status for rate-limiting + debugging.

### Is it open source?
Yes — MIT license, full source in this repo.

### Can I run it inside my company's VPC?
Yes — `server/` is plain PHP, no external service dependencies except `app.ranki.io` for the bridge tools (which you can disable by removing those tool files).

### How is this different from competitors like Surfer / Frase / Outrank?
Those are SaaS dashboards that audit one URL at a time and recommend changes. Ranki MCP is a **protocol layer** that lets your AI use those audits inline while it's writing code in your IDE. Different shape, different price point (free), different audience (vibe-coders, not SEO professionals).

### I'm a vibe-coder and I have no idea what AEO means.
That's literally who this is for. Start with `seo_starter_kit("yourdomain.com")` — your Claude will walk you through everything.

### Will you train AI on my data?
We don't train models. We don't have models. We're a thin advisor over deterministic checks.
